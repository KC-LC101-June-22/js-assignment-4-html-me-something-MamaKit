               <h2>Correspondences</h2>
               <h3><a name="animals"></a>Animals</h3>
               <p>
                     Animals the world over are believed to have various attributes and powers. These attributes can vary greatly depending on culture & history. For example: In the United States, a black cat crossing your path is considered unlucky. However, in England, a black cat crossing your path is good luck, while a white cat is concerned incredibly unlucky. Comparing both these attributions with Ancient Egypt, where cats were worshipped as gods, shows that <b>great</b> variations in correspondence between animals and their attirbutions & powers. For my purposes, I will be including my own personal correspondences.
               </p>

               <h3><a name="colors"></a>Colors</h3>
               <p>
                     Colors have always elicited a rather visceral reaction from us. Mostly, you either love a given color, or you <b>HATE</b> it with the fiery passion of 1,000,000,000 supernovas. Color theory takes these reactions & responses, & defines the average response to different colors. Magically speaking, each of us does the same thing. When you have to make a big presentation, do you wear a color you love for a confidence boost, or a color that you hate? That's literally a low-key spell. So, let's jump into some of the basic color correspondences.

               <h2>Deities</h2>
               <p>
                  I have always been drawn to stories of gods, heroes, & villains, regardless of the culture. Ancient Egyptian, Greek, First Nations, Scottish, Irish, Norse. All hold appeal. I have worked with deities from all the aforementioned pantheons, except First Nations pantheons. There are two reasons for this.
                  <ol>
                     <li>Despite family history on both sides claiming Cherokee blood, I cannot find any records to support it. Without a legitimate claim to the heritage, trying to worship the gods of a closed pantheon is both disrespectful & stupid.</li>
                     <li>I've never felt called to any of the entities I discovered in the course of my research.</li>
                  </ol>
               </p>
               <p>
                  Below I have listed the primary deities that I have previously &/or currently work with &/or worship.

                        I started working with Apollo while I was in high school. One of our humanities classes focused on Greco-Roman myths, & the book we used listed Apollo as a healing god. I've always been clumsy. So, having to literally run down hallways & up-&-down stairs carrying a backpack that weighed at least much as (& often more than) me, I ended up with a lot of pulled muscles, twisted ankles, & jammed fingers. Connecting with the Earth & praying to Apollo for healing got me through a lot of gym classes without having to pack up & hike to the other end of campus to see the secretary. (Our school only had a nurse for 2 hours on Thursday mornings.)
                     <br><br>
                        At some point, he swapped out with his brother Hermes. Neither of them bothered to tell me about it, choosing instead to wait & see how long it took me to figure it out. (Answer: It was <b>YEARS</b>!)

                     I'm honestly not sure when I started working with Hermes, thanks to his & Apollo's little prank. Although, it <b>IS</b> incredibly "on-brand" for both of them. What finally tipped me off was that Hermes didn't react to a long-running jibe I had with Apollo. Any time Apollo expressed displeasure with something, I'd joke that I was sure he'd rather I wasn't "a Cassandra" (lie to him about my motives or intentions). The day he didn't react to it, I knew something was up. It still took me a little time to figure out it was Hermes answering me, though.

                  I'm not exactly sure what my relationship with Loki <b><i>IS</i></b>. He's kinda just always been around. I've randomly encountered &/or attracted his followers throughout my life. And, they are invariably surprised that I'm not also his devotee.
                  <br><br>
                  In truth, my life is chaotic enough without inviting a literal chaos gerblin god into it. On the flip side, he might be controbuting to that chaos because I won't work with him as closely as he thinks I should. It's a toss up, & I'm switherin whether to tempt fate to find out.

               <h2>Spells</h2>
               <p>Spellcraft is often the first thing someone tries. And, it can be entirely intuitive. You don't <b>have</b> to know the traditional meanings of things. You can use what feels right to you, what you have available. But, my personal experience shows that it packs more punch when you align with traditional correspondences.</p>
